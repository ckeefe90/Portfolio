          <summary>A Little About Me</summary>
          <p>I realized at a young age that I have a passion for both learning and teaching. After high school I became a Preschool Teacher for about 5 years. While I loved teaching I ended up making a career change into the office world. I spent the next 5 years working at an equipment leasing company learning everything I could about the processes and procedures for multiple departments. Before long I was creating a delinquency calendar for the collections team and creating e-mail templates for multiple departments to use; among other things.</p>
          <p>This left me wanting to know more about the technical side of things. Like the most efficient way to create and deploy the templates to the teams. What goes into creating a functional application or website. How buttons are added, updated or removed. At the end of June 2020 I enrolled as a student at Thinkful for Software Engineering and started my journey to become a software engineer!</p>
          <p>I can't wait to complete this bootcamp and start working as a professional software engineer with a team of experienced programmers to learn hands on from them and to share any new knowledge I have that they may not know.</p>
          <h2>As a professional software engineer I hope to</h2> 
            <ul>
              <li>Do freelance work with small business owners to create the website of their dreams at an affordable rate.</li>
              <li>As my skills develop create more complex web applications.</li>
              <li>Create and operate my own cooking website (this will be one of my projects to update below as it develops)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When I'm not working I like to:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Cook up some new recipes</li>
                <li>Try craft beers - if you know of any good coffee ones let me know!</li>
              </ul>

            <h2><em>So far I've noticed some similarities between coding and cooking:</em></h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Much like a recipe, a website can require multiple "ingredients" of code before it's complete.</li>
                <li>If you forget or change one ingredient it can completely change the final result.</li>
                <li>You can get the same end result using different ingredients.</li>
                <li>The options are endless with both recipes and coding.</li>
              </ol>
